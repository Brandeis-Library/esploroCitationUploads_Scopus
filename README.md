# esploroCitationUploads_Scopus
This Python script will take a simple text file containing DOIs from Esploro and loop through them using the Scopus API to extract citation counts. Once it has looped through the file, it will transfer the DOI and the Total Citation Count into a number of Excel files where each file is not to exceed 999 rows each, in keeping with the limitations on the Esploro loader.

To run the code, simply add your Scopus API key to the code and ensure you have each of the four dependencies installed in your Python3 environment.

Assistance in generating this code goes to Perplexity.ai. I had to make some adjustments and corrections, but the core elements of this code are AI generated.
